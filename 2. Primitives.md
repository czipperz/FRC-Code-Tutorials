#Primitives

Primitives are the basic building blocks of `Java`. An understanding of these is essential to being able to program with `Java`.

* `int` (integer) - an integer number value.
_Examples:_ `15`, `-27`, `9993`, `-423807`, `0`

* `doubles` (decimal) - a precise decimal, but takes up more space.
_Examples:_ `15.0`, `-67.5437890674`, `54238954327.43829105`

* `char` (character) - a single letter. Surround the letter with single quotes.
_Examples:_ `'a'`, `'s'`, `'1'`, `'%'`

* `boolean` (true or false) - while usually compiled by a variety of statements, which will be covered in future lessons, they can also accept true or false directly.
_Examples:_ `true`, `false`, `bankBalance > 3000`, `bankBalance <= 0`

##Some lesser used but still very important primitives

* `float` (small decimals) - we won't use this primitive much, but it stores *less* data than a double while maintaining decimal capability. We won't be using these much. Their names are postfixed with a `f` to distinguish from `double`s.
_Examples:_ `15.0f`, `4321780.213890f`

* `long` (large integers) - these are integers that want to be super big. For example, a long value is used to represent the number of miliseconds that have occured since the epoch. Their names are postfixed with a `l` to distinguish from `int`s.
_Examples:_ `213891022361879l`, `4327189043277l`
