#Primitives

* `int` (integer) - an integer number value.
__Examples:__ `15`, `-27`, `9993`, `-423807`, `0`

* `doubles` (decimal) - a precise decimal, but takes up more space.
__Examples:__ `15.0`, `-67.5437890674`, `54238954327.43829105`

* `floats` (small decimals) - we won't use this primitive much, but it stores less data than a double while maintaining decimal capability. We won't be using these much.

* `char` (character) - a single letter. Surround the letter with single quotes.
__Examples:__ `'a'`, `'s'`, `'1'`, `'%'`

* `boolean` (true or false) - while usually compiled by a variety of statements, which will be covered in the next lesson, they can also accept true or false directly.
__Examples:__ `true`, `false`, `bankBalance > 3000`, `bankBalance <= 0`
