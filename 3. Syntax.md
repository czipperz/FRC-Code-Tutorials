#Syntax

I want to discuss some fundamental concepts in Java. Don't worry if you feel lost, come and see somebody at a robotics meeting and we'll be glad to help.

* Comments - A few symbols can be used that will cause code or text to not be processed, allowing the coder to leave comments for later usage.
To leave a single line comment, use `//`. This will comment out the rest of a line, no matter what.
To leave multi line comments, use `/*` to start them and `*/` to end. The text in the middle will be ignored.

* Line Spacing is purely for show - Some modern programming languages use tabs to express blocks and don't use semicolons.
Java is an older language, so it uses `{` to open a block of code, and `}` to close it.
Semicolons are required to be at the end of most commands. Notable exceptions are those that start a block. If a statement is continued over multiple lines, Java doesn't care and won't expect a special symbol so that it can interpret it.

* Classes - This is the basic unit of Java. Every class has a 

* Method - A Method takes some inputs and returns an output. Many methods take no input and many give no output. Methods are useful for many different tasks and will mostly serve a purpose, such as changing the speed of the motors on a robot depending on the read values of a joystick.
Method arguments are placed in the parenthesis following the method name.
_Example:_ `public int getAmmountOfCash() { return ammountOfCash; }` - this method takes no inputs, because the types of inputs in the parenthesis is blank, and returns an integer value. Methods should be named to reflect their purpose. In this case, `getAmmountOfCash()` allows us to see that this method should give us the ammount of cash for this object.
`public void computeMotorSpeeds(double left, double right) { /* method body */ }` should take two doubles, decimal precision values, that represent Joystick values and apply them to the motors. The word `void` signifies that the method has no return type.

* Objects - A set a set of data that applies to a "template" of a class. Their declaration comes in a few forms. They can be abstract or final, as covered in inheritance, or a "normal" class. Objects of the same class will have the same method and variable names, but their values are most likely differing.

* Inheritance - This means that this class or interface has an *is-a* relationship with another class or interface. Classes can inherit from any amount of interfaces and or one other class, but interfaces can only inherit other interfaces. Two key words are used to manipulate inheritance for classes. The `abstract` keyword causes a class to become an abstract class and shows that there must be another class that inherits from the current one. Abstract classes can declare some methods as abstract so that they are forced to be differently implemented in separate sub classes. The `final` keyword makes extending the class illegal. Final classes cannot be abstract for obvious reasons.  Interfaces are designed with inheritance in mind, as almost all of their methods are overwriten by each implementing class.
    * When thinking about inheritance, think about animals. A class `Animal` (as in `public abstract class Animal {`) could declare methods like `abstract public void eat()`, where `abstract` means that sub classes have to write the body code for it, and `public void getName() { return name; }`. A cat class that `extends` (as in `public class Cat extends Animal {`) must declare its own version of the `eat()` method, and optionally can declare its own version of the `getName()` method.

A class is one of the type of Java files. It defines a template for making objects.

`static` - this keyword means that this method or variable is changed and accessed at the level of 

--------------------------------------------------

##Visibility

I think visibility is important enough to deserve a summary of its own.

* `private` - this signifies that this component, is only visible in the current file you are working on.
_Example:_ `private int ammountOfCash;` - this tells Java that the _**only** things_ that can directly use the variable ammountOfCash are in the same file as this variable.

* - not having a visibility is also a visibility! It is called the default visibility. This is the least used, ironically. We won't utilize it but it will only allow things in the direct package the code is made to use it. You will learn what a package is below.

* `protected` - allows the same visibility given by the default visibility but also allows the subclasses and their packages to access the component.

* `public` - this allows anything that has a reference to this object to call it.

--------------------------------------------------

##Now Some Analysis of an Example

Java syntax looks like the following code:

    import java.security.InvalidParameterException;

    public class BankAccount {
    	private int ammountOfCash;
    
    	public BankAccount(int initialDeposit) {
    		this.ammountOfCash = initialDeposit;
    	}
    
    	public int getAmmountOfCash() {
    		return ammountOfCash;
    	}

    	public void setAmmountOfCash(int newAmmount) {
    		if(newAmmount < 0)
    			throw new InvalidParameterException("There must be at least zero dollars in the bank account");
    		this.ammountOfCash = newAmmount;
    	}
    }

I will walk you through each line in order.

    import java.security.InvalidParameterException;

This line is called an import statement. It tells Java which version (if multiple made one) of `InvalidParameterException` to use and then allows us to use it in this Java file. If we accidentally made our own `InvalidParameterException`, then we would need to specify this statement to a different location. Learning where all of these classes are is generally not an issue because the *Integrated Development Environment*, or `IDE`, will find where the class is for us.

==================================================

    public class BankAccount {

This line specifies the the visibility, the type, and the name of the class that we are working on. For every normal case, this will be the name of the file. This *class*'s name is BankAccount and this *file* is named `BankAccount.java`. It will specify a template for object creation that ends at the corresponding `}`.

==================================================

    private int ammountOfCash;
    
This line declares a variable, `ammountOfCash`, that represents the amount of cash in the bank account. We use this method of naming, called *cammel case*, that allows us to consistently name variables and methods. Note that a space in the variable name will result in an error. `ammountOfCash` is private so only this file can access it, preventing a random stranger from being able to take money from your account. The word `int` specifies ammountOfCash as an integer, allowing for large sums to be used.

==================================================

    public BankAccount(int initialDeposit) {

This line is a constructor statement, followed by `{` that represents the start of the body. `public` tells Java that anyone can make a BankAccount with this constructor. `BankAccount` is the name of the class that is going to be created. `(int initialDeposit)` shows that there is one parameter, a required input, to be able to create an instance of the class with this constructor.

==================================================

    this.ammountOfCash = initialDeposit;

This declares the field variable, `ammountOfCash`, with the value `initialDeposit` that was given as an argument. If we name the parameter of a method or constructor with the same name as a field variable, then we can use a reference to this object, `this` to access the variable. The `.` allows us to use variables and methods on the object specified, in this case `this`.  General syntax for setters is `varName = value;`.
