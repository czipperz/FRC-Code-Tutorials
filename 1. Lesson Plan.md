#Lesson Plan

The official handbook says that this is all the information deemed necessary for new members of the **997 Software Team** and about nothing else. I plan to expand upon this to offer a complete introduction to Java. We will be using the code for Robotics as an example in later tutorial / slides.

Java is an `Object Oriented` language, which means that you create different objects that handle precise tasks so that they are easily re-usable by future projects or multiple different ways in the current. All code is contained in a `class` that is usually recreatable.
