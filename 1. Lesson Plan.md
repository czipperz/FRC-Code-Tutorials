#Lesson Plan

The following few pages detail information deemed necessary for new members of the _**997 Software Team**_ to know. This material should not be presented by itself, nor should it be considered the *end all, be all* of software education. Frequent use of outside references, material, and examples is recommended. For maximum student engagement, hands-on experience is a _**must**_. This material is meant to provide a common basis of understanding upon which to build and expand. Basically, this *isn't* all you need to learn or teach.
