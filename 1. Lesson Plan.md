#Lesson Plan

The following markdown files detail information deemed necessary for new members of the **997 Software Team** to know.
This material should not be presented by itself, nor should it be considered the *end all, be all* of software education.
Frequent use of outside references, material, and examples is recommended.
For maximum student engagement, hands-on experience is a *must*.
This material is meant to provide a common basis of understanding upon which to build and expand.
Basically, this *isn't* all you need to learn or teach.
